As part of the Big Data and AI Engineering Onsite Bootcamp, we are asked to search for a dataset to visulise it using buisness intelligence tools. The project has to have an impact and deliver clear insights with actionable plans.

## Business Objective

Many accidents have been trending in the US, notably in the previous two years from racist officers. For example, the accident named “I Can’t Breathe” which happened in New York, in 2019. This accident sparked a movement by black people titled Black Lives Matter. All of those accidents were inhumane for many individuals; especially to our team. This led us to dig behind the explanations and the factors of the initiation of these accidents. Thus, we stumbled into a dataset that struck our interest, which is about the US Police Shootings in the US from 2015 to 2020. We will explain the dataset, its description, attributes, and some insights acquired based on a visualization that we made in **Tableau** that summarized most of the noteworthy interactions between the attributes.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Tableau

## Dataset Overview
This dataset examines police shootings in the United States. It precisely measures the common racism in America. We had no need to clean or alter the dataset, as it was 
absolutely flawless. It offers basic information about the shot victims, including their names, ages, genders, and races. In addition to the shooting and death information, the following questions illustrate our rationale for selecting the dataset:
• The date of the occurrence and the location where it occurred.
• How did they get shot? Did they attack?
• Were they carrying arms?
• Did they exhibit signs of mental illness?
• Was a camera worn by the police officer, or was the incident recorded?
• Did the victim run away?
• What type of weapons were employed by law enforcement?

## Visualization

Based on our [EDA](https://medium.com/@RghdE/investments-analysis-dataset-predicting-customer-investment-based-on-visitors-activity-logs-using-b725ad1fa559), we found that 80% of our users are regular visitors, while only 17% are investors, thus, we wanted to create two dashboards for these two user types.

Visitors dashboard:
