# :bar_chart: BI-Project
As part of the Big Data and AI Engineering Onsite Bootcamp, we are asked to search for a dataset and visualize it using business intelligence tools. The project has to have an impact and deliver clear insights with actionable plans.

## Business Objective

Many accidents have been trending in the US, notably in the previous two years from racist officers. For example, the accident named “I Can’t Breathe” which happened in New York, in 2019. This accident sparked a movement by black people titled Black Lives Matter. All of those accidents were inhumane for many individuals; especially to our team. This led us to dig behind the explanations and the factors of the initiation of these accidents. Thus, we stumbled into a dataset that struck our interest, which is about the US Police Shootings in the US from 2015 to 2020. We will explain the dataset, its description, attributes, and some insights acquired based on a visualization that we made in **Tableau** that summarized most of the noteworthy interactions between the attributes.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Tableau

## Dataset Overview
This dataset examines police shootings in the United States. It precisely measures the common racism in America. We had no need to clean or alter the dataset, as it was 
absolutely flawless. It offers basic information about the shot victims, including their names, ages, genders, and races. In addition to the shooting and death information, the following questions illustrate our rationale for selecting the dataset:

* The date of the occurrence and the location where it occurred.
* How did they get shot? Did they attack?
* Were they carrying arms?
* Did they exhibit signs of mental illness?
* Was a camera worn by the police officer, or was the incident recorded?
* Did the victim run away?
* What type of weapons were employed by law enforcement?

## Visualization

The following dashboards were created after making sure that there are no preprocessing steps needed.

On the basis of the dashboard's visualization, the following preventative measures are recommended:
* Based on the state and the number of shootings, they must **mandate that all police officers turn on their cameras and establish sanctions for those who do not comply**.
* In light of the racial diversity of those who have been murdered, **the U.S. government should expand its activities to raise awareness about the consequences of racism**. And avoid bias by including all races in these campaigns.
* **Adding a relief button to police uniforms to be pressed prior to an exchange of gunfire or if the police are threatened**, so that the police station can assess the 
severity of the situation and send police cars to the scene without informing the criminal, thereby preventing a return to gun use and murder.
* **Providing the police officers with intensive training on how to conduct conversations and control their emotions in order to control their actions as provocations escalate**, hence reducing the number of fatalities in these situations. From the amount of closed cameras, it may be inferred that there was a conversation the police did not want recorded in order to protect their careers
